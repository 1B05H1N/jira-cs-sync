# jira-cs-sync

This can be used to sync a Jira Issues to Crowdstrike Alerts and Incidents.

## Overview

This script synchronizes CrowdStrike incident and alert data with a JIRA Cloud project using the CrowdStrike SOAR JIRA plugin. The SOAR workflow creates an incident or alert as a JIRA issue and appends a comment containing the CrowdStrike incident/alert ID. JIRA automation must then parse this comment and set a custom field (e.g., `cs_incident_id` or `cs_alert_id`) in the issue. This script uses that custom field to link the CrowdStrike record to the JIRA issue and subsequently synchronizes comments, status, and assignee information.

## Prerequisites

### Software Requirements

- **Python 3.x**

### Python Packages

Install the required Python packages with:

```bash
pip install crowdstrike-falconpy jira pyyaml python-json-logger
```

## Permissions and Environment Variables

Before running the script, ensure you have set up the following environment variables with the appropriate permissions:

- **For CrowdStrike:**
  - `CS_CLIENT_ID`  
  - `CS_CLIENT_SECRET`  
  These credentials must have read/write permissions to incidents, alerts, and detections in your CrowdStrike environment.

- **For JIRA:**
  - `JIRA_SERVER`  
  - `JIRA_USERNAME`  
  - `JIRA_API_TOKEN`  
  These credentials must have read and write permissions to the JIRA project you wish to synchronize.

## Configuration

The script uses a YAML configuration file (`sync_config.yaml`) to determine key settings. Below is an example configuration:

```yaml
# sync_config.yaml

jira_project_key: "your_jira_project_key" # Jira project key

custom_fields:
  incident:
    display_name: "your_jira_custom_incident_name_field" # Custom field name in Jira for incident IDs
    field_id: "your_jira_custom_incident_ID_field"          # Custom field ID in Jira for incident IDs
  alert:
    display_name: "your_jira_custom_alert_name_field"        # Custom field name in Jira for alert IDs
    field_id: "your_jira_custom_alert_name_field"            # Custom field ID in Jira for alert IDs

jira_status_mapping_incidents:
  new: 20
  reopened: 25
  in progress: 30
  done: 40

jira_status_mapping_alerts:
  ignored: "ignored"
  new: "new"
  in progress: "in_progress"
  true positive: "true_positive"
  false positive: "false_positive"

open_statuses:
  - "To Do"
  - "In Progress"
  - "Reopened"

sync_options:
  sync_status: true
  sync_assignee: true
  sync_comments: true
  sync_comments_for_closed: false

# Jira UUID to CrowdStrike (Cortex) UUID mapping
jira_to_cs_user_map:
  "jira_user_1": "cs_user_uuid_1"
  "jira_user_2": "cs_user_uuid_2"

max_workers: 5
max_retries: 5
backoff_factor: 2
poll_interval: 60
```

### Important Configuration Notes

- **Custom Fields:**  
  - Update the `custom_fields` section with your JIRA projectâ€™s custom field names and IDs that will store the CrowdStrike incident or alert IDs.
  
- **User Mapping:**  
  - The `jira_to_cs_user_map` provides the mapping between your JIRA user IDs and CrowdStrike user UUIDs.  
  **Ensure that these mappings reflect your environment.**

- **Sync Options:**  
  - The `sync_options.sync_comments_for_closed` flag controls whether comments are synced for closed issues.  
    Set it to `false` to stop syncing comments for closed issues, which is the recommended setting for most workflows.

## How It Works

1. **SOAR Workflow Integration:**  
   The CrowdStrike SOAR workflow creates a JIRA issue (incident or alert) and appends a comment containing the CrowdStrike ID.

2. **JIRA Automation:**  
   You must create JIRA automation rules that trigger upon the comment being added and parse the CrowdStrike ID from the comment. This parsed ID is then set on a custom field in the issue.

3. **Script Processing:**  
   The script:
   - Loads configuration and dynamically reloads it if it changes.
   - Reads the custom fields in the JIRA issues to identify the corresponding CrowdStrike incident/alert.
   - Syncs comments, status, and assignee data (if enabled) between JIRA and CrowdStrike.
   - Supports options such as not syncing comments for closed issues (controlled by `sync_comments_for_closed`).

## Running the Script

1. **Set up your environment variables** for CrowdStrike and JIRA credentials.
2. **Configure the `sync_config.yaml` file** according to your environment (adjust project key, custom field names/IDs, user mappings, etc.).
3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python3 jira_cs_sync.py
   ```
